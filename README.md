# Datatables PHP PDO (Server Side Script - Sample)

This is a brief sample using the [DataTables plugin](https://datatables.net) in a server side scripting with PHP-PDO using PostgreSQL but it could easily be modified to implement MySQL.


## Rationale
I decided to start with this code sample because I all similar samples that I found were mixing the SQL query with the server side logic to return results. My main goal was to produce some kind of widget that passing a query can be capable to return results, paginate, sort and filter. Also, the most important thing: easy to integrate as many times as needed in a single project or web page. This code needs a lot of improvement but is a good starting.





## How to use
